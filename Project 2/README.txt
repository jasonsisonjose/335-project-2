  This project is an example of implementing different sorting functions and putting them to the test in a race. The quicker sort finishes first!
  Each line represents a new pass in the sorting algorithm. Place your bets! Let's see who will win!

  File Algorithm Analysis ;  This file includes the run time and big O analysis of our program and sorting functions

  File readme.txt.  This file.

  File quickSort.js ; This contains the sorting implementation for quick sort

  File mergeSort.js ;  This contains the sorting implementation for merge sort

  file poreSortStep.js ; This contains the sorting implementation for pore sort

  File index-js-p5-example.html. Drag and drop this into a browser to
    run the example.

  File p5.js. This is the P5 package.

  File cs-sketch.js; This contains several P5 user-defined linkage functions
   (setup, draw, keyPressed, and mousePressed), as well as example
    support functions.

  File assets/styles.css.  This is an extra-small example of controlling
    webpage styling.

  File assets/draw-stuff.js. This is an example to show loading a JS
    script file from a folder other than the index.html file's
    location.  It also includes the utility draw_grid function written
    in P5+JS.  (Picture "snapped" with the Windows Snip tool.)

Installation & Running

  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder.

  2. Drag the index HTML file, index-js-p5-example.html, into a browser
    window.  The example P5 program should start immediately.

Known Bugs

  o- Merge Sort doesn't display steps, just the final outcome
  o- Quick Sort switches duplicate positions, resulting in additonal passes
